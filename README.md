This project contains source code for Best Practices for PDI Plugins.

* __pdi-step-code-coverage__: Best Practice (Forthcoming) will show how to automatically check unit test coverage using the Jacoco plugin in a PDI Step Plugin.  We begin with the output of the [Step Plugin PDI Maven Archetype](https://github.com/pentaho/maven-project-archetypes/tree/master/pentaho-pdi-step-plugin-archetype), configure Jacoco, and introduce some basic unit tests.

* __pdi-checkstyle-plugin__:  The Best Practice (Forthcoming) begins with a fork of pdi-step-code-coverage. We then continue building out our sample by adding automated code style coverage using the Checkstyle plugin.  We show how to configure automatic style checking in Eclipse and IntelliJ idea.
