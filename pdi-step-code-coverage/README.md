# PDI Step Code Coverage Sample

This is a sample project based on the Pentaho [PDI Step Arhectype](https://github.com/pentaho/maven-project-archetypes/tree/master/pentaho-pdi-step-plugin-archetype).  Beginning with that archetype, we have added support for using the Jacoco Code Coverage plugin.  This sample project is further documented in the best practices document, "Pentaho PDI Step Plugins -- Unit Test Code Coverage" (forthcoming).

#### Pre-requisites for building the project:
* Maven, version 3+
* Java JDK 1.8
* This [settings.xml](https://github.com/pentaho/maven-parent-poms/blob/master/maven-support-files/settings.xml) in your <user-home>/.m2 directory


__IntelliJ__

* Don't use IntelliJ's built-in maven. Make it use the same one you use from the commandline.
  * Project Preferences -> Build, Execution, Deployment -> Build Tools -> Maven ==> Maven home directory
